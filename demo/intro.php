		<h1><strong>Openskull CSS Framework</strong></h1>
		<h2>You shouldn't have to fight against your CSS framework.</h2>
		<p>Openskull.css is a small, flexbox, mobile first, and rem based CSS library that aims to make web development fast and easy.</p>
		<p>Many popular CSS frameworks apply borders, font styles, border-radius, shadows, and more to their classes. This looks more pleasant out of the box, but it costs time and frustration when developers have to spend time "unstyling" the element.</p>
		<p>Instead, this framework is a collection of <strong>good defaults</strong> and <strong>helper classes</strong> that you can combine to get your desired style while minimizing the amount of CSS you need to <em>unwrite</em>. This can help save a lot of time in development. </p>

				<p>This framework strives to set itself apart by being more lightweight than its alternatives without sacrificing useful functionality. Openskull.css tries to follow some of the standards that major libraries such as bootstrap have set forward, and developers who've used them will find openskull.css familiar.</p>

			<p>This page was built entirely with openskull.css. There are no additional demo css rules.</p>
			<p>A lot of frameworks have advanced demo.css to make things look really nice and presentable, but with this framework you can see what you're getting.</p>

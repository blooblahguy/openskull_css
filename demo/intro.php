		<h1><strong>Openskull CSS Framework</strong></h1>
		<h2 class="subtitle">You shouldn't have to fight against your CSS framework.</h2>
		<p>Many popular CSS frameworks apply borders, font styles, border-radius, shadows, and more to their classes. This looks more pleasant out of the box, but it costs time and frustration when developers have to spend time "unstyling" the element.</p>
		<p>Instead, this framework is a collection of <strong>helper classes</strong> that you can combine to get your desired style while minimizing the amount of CSS you need to <em>unwrite</em>. This can help save a lot of time in development. </p>
